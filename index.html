    <p><strong>Pursuing the Plan (My Mission)</strong><br>
        </br>

        As millennials some of us were never taught how to be happy because life was always about survival. Lots of us
        are first generation Americans where living your dreams meant going to college to obtain a degree to either
        become a doctor, lawyer or engineer because that’s what equates to prosperity. Happiness was never a factor
        because like myself coming from a family that is from a third world country resources were scarce and only the
        strong survived. In 2019, times have changed! We have much more success stories from people who did not take the
        traditional route and focused on what they loved. These people went against the grain without external support
        but they thrived because they had internal confidence. Self-love is the act of loving and putting your
        <strong>AUTHENTIC</strong> self first. My mission is to help everyone realize God made us unique and in our
        differences come our specialties. These specialities can translate into skills that we as millennials can
        monetize to fund our true passions.

    <h3>Sophie’s Specialty to Self-Love (The Service)</h3>

    <p>Through my life experiences with domestic violence, mental health disorders, spirituality, suicide, love for the
        LGBT community, homelessness, infidelity in relationships and many more topics; I have learned a lot about
        people and the world. I had to figure out how to center myself. With meditation, travel and dance I have
        overcome lots of empty feelings and I want to share my journey to help emerge
        <em>your unique expedition of love.</em> </p>
